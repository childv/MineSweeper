# MineSweeper
A simple MineSweeper game for Android.



The purpose of this implement was to understand Activity creation, XML UIs, Custom Views, and basic View components on Android mobile.

A 5x5 covered game area contains 4 mines. Depending on the ToggleButton setting, the player can either place a flag or "Try" a field.
By trying a field, the player reveals either a mine or a number indicating how many adjacent tiles have a mine.
If the player flags a field but there is no mine, the game ends.
If the player correctly flags all the fields with mines until there are no more mines, the game ends and the player wins.
